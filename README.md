<h1> PE04---ProfileCards </h1>

<h1>Input</h1>
<p>While there is no explicit user input, it could be argued that the user clicking on a thumbnail is an input as it adjusts how the cards are viewed.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>The index.tsx points to the App.js file for the application. Within the App.js file, the necessary design tools are imported. Additionally, an array of "John Doe"s is created. The design of the profile card is established and then rendered to allow the adjustment of the size of the thumbnail when users click on it. Some styling items to point out are the card layout which uses flexbox as well as the blown-up-thumbnail-view which uses a scale to adjust the size of the components when a user selects the card.</p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>The output is an arrray of cards that change size when users select a thumbnail.</p>
